PyZUI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

This PyZUI fork was developed with debian 13 "trixie" as d.e and a miniconda for 
dependencies management. It has also been tested on AArch64 and Win11, always with a 
miniconda enviroment managing all dependencies.

original project can be found at:
https://github.com/davidar/pyzui

DEPENDENCIES
============

All dependencies have been installed in a miniconda enviroment, the following
ones trough the default Anaconda channel:

Basic usage: conda install "package"="version number"

PyZui has been developed with the following python version

- python=3.12.9

PyZUI depends on the following Python packages:

- qt-main=5.15.2
- qt-webengine=5.15.9
- qtawesome=1.4.0
- qtpy=2.4.1
- pyqt=5.15.10
- pyqt5-sip=12.13.0
- pyqtwebengine=5.15.10

- pillow=9.4.0

The following non-Python packages are also required by certain features of the
application, thhose are installed trough the Conda-Forge Anaconda channel. Especially if
you run linux those packages may already be present on your system and may work, it's 
nevertheless highly reccomended to install them in the conda enviroment:

Basic usage: conda install -c conda-forge "package"="version number"

- imagemagick=7.1.1_5 
  (highly recommended, but strictly optional if you do not intend
  using images of any format other than PPM; the absence of ImageMagick may
  also break other parts of the application as well);
- poppler=24.09.0
  pdftoppm from Poppler or Xpdf (optional if you do not intend viewing PDFs);

UBUNTU/DEBIAN SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
===================================
PyQt4, PIL and ImageMagick can be installed in Debian-based distributions by:
  apt-get install python-qt4 python-imaging imagemagick

pdftoppm can be installed by either:
  apt-get install poppler-utils
or:
  apt-get install xpdf-reader

jrMandel can be downloaded from <http://freshmeat.net/projects/jrmandel/>,
and installed with the standard:
  ./configure && make && make install

WINDOWS SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
=============================
PyQt4, PIL and ImageMagick can be installed in Windows by downloading and
running the installers available from their respective websites:
- http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
- http://pythonware.com/products/pil/
- http://imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows

Due to a conflict between the the 'convert.exe' provided by ImageMagick and
that provided by Windows NT/2000/XP (see
<http://savage.net.au/ImageMagick/html/install-convert.html>), you will need to
rename the 'convert.exe' provided by ImageMagick (in
C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-XXXXXXXXX\) to 'imconvert.exe'.

pdftoppm can be installed by downloading the Win32 binary zip archive from
<http://foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html>, extracting it, and copying
'pdftoppm.exe' to somewhere in your PATH (such as C:\WINDOWS\system32\).

I haven't tried using jrMandel on Windows as it would need to be compiled from
source with something like MSVC, and I'm not even sure it is supported on
Windows.

RUNNING PyZUI
=============
PyZUI can be run by executing the script 'main.py'. It is not necessary to run
this from the command-line (unless you want to view the logging), and it can be
run from any directory (the script will set the set the working directory
appropriately by itself).

In Windows just double-click on 'main.py'. If you don't want the logging window
to be shown, rename it to 'main.pyw' first.
