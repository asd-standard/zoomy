PyZUI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

This PyZUI fork was developed with debian 13 "trixie" as d.e and a miniconda for 
dependencies management. It has also been tested on AArch64 and Win11, always with a 
miniconda enviroment managing all dependencies.

original project can be found at:
https://github.com/davidar/pyzui

DEPENDENCIES
============

PyZui has been developed with the following python version

- python=3.12.9

All dependencies have been installed in a miniconda enviroment, for all 3 platforms tested
the procedure has always been to install miniconda, create an enviroment:

  conda create -n "enviroment name" python=python=3.12.9
  
And activate such enviroment

  conda activate "enviroment name"

with all the core dependencies installed trough the default Anaconda channel:

  conda install "package"="version number"

PyZUI depends on the following Python packages:

- qt-main=5.15.2
- qt-webengine=5.15.9
- qtawesome=1.4.0
- qtpy=2.4.1
- pyqt=5.15.10
- pyqt5-sip=12.13.0
- pyqtwebengine=5.15.10

- pillow=9.4.0

The following non-Python packages are also required by certain features of the
application, those are installed trough the Conda-Forge Anaconda channel. Especially if
you run linux those packages may already be present on your system and may work, it's 
nevertheless highly reccomended to install them in the conda enviroment:

  conda install -c conda-forge "package"="version number"

- imagemagick=7.1.1_5 
  (highly recommended, but strictly optional if you do not intend
  using images of any format other than PPM; the absence of ImageMagick may
  also break other parts of the application as well);

- poppler=24.09.0
  pdftoppm from Poppler or Xpdf (optional if you do not intend viewing PDFs);

After completion of this dependencies set up you can install  

UBUNTU/DEBIAN, AArch64, SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

- Install miniconda and follow the instructions in the DEPENDENCIES section

- RUNNING PyZUI
  ============

- PyZUI can be run by executing the script 'main.py': 

  python main.py
 
- It is not necessary to run this from the command-line (unless you want to view the    
  logging), and it can be run from any directory (the script will set the set the working 
  directory appropriately by itself).

WINDOWS SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

- You have to install Windows subsystem for linux, (wsl), the default linux distribution   
  should work, nevertheless if you want to be 100% sure th PyZui have been tested with 
  ubuntu 24.04.

- Once you have wsl installed you need to install miniconda on it, then you can create an
  enviroment and install all the dependencies as explained in the DEPENDENCIES 
  section.  

- RUNNING PyZUI
  =============

- You can then run PyZui by launching your wsl enviroment, navigate to the root of the 
  pyzui project and run:

  python main.py
